Hello! My name is Daniel and I am a PhD candidate in [Bioinformatics](https://www.iq.usp.br/portaliqusp/?q=en/postgraduate-bioinformatics) at the [Taran Grant's Lab](https://grant.ib.usp.br/anfibios/homePage.html), University of São Paulo, Brazil (2022--ongoing). During my PhD research, I was intern at [Ward Wheeler's Lab](https://wardwheeler.wordpress.com/), American Museum of Natural History, New York, U.S (2024--2025). Before starting graduate school, I obtained a BSc and Teacher's degree in Biology at University of São Paulo (2017--2022).

I am interested in Zoology and Genetics. Specifically, the goal of my research is providing methodological advances and empirical applications of ancient DNA, phylogenetic systematics, and macroevolution of amphibians. Previously, I developed softwares to facilitate preprocessing of sequences for dynamic homology ([prepDyn](https://github.com/dnakamuraz/prepDyn)) and tree comparisons ([RNODE](https://github.com/dnakamuraz/RNODE)). I also applied museomics to resolve problems in systematics of extinct amphibians ([Nakamura et al. 2025a](https://doi.org/10.25225/jvb.24112), [b](https://doi.org/10.1655/Herpetologica-D-24-00036)). My ultimate goal is to address methodological problems in bioinformatics (high-throughput DNA assembly, alignment, and phylogenetics) and resolve empirical problems related with systematics and conservation of lost amphibians.
