Hello! I'm Sakib Ibne Salam, a computational biologist based at the Medical College of Wisconsin. My work focuses on translating genomic data into actionable clinical insights for cancer and complex disease.
<br><br>
I enjoy building reproducible analysis pipelines, designing intuitive visualizations, and collaborating closely with clinicians and experimental biologists. When I'm not deep in code or data, you'll likely find me exploring new tech stacks, mentoring trainees, or writing about translational bioinformatics.
