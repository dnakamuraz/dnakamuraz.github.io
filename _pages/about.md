I am a PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.mcw.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu/). I obtained my MS in Mathematics (Statistics emphasis) from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/) and my BS in Statistics from the [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/).

My research focuses on developing and applying Bayesian methods for variable selection, external data borrowing, and genomics. I am particularly interested in advancing statistical methodologies that integrate multi-source biomedical data to improve inference and decision-making in clinical and genomic research.

Outside of research, I enjoy watching movies, trivia nights, traveling, reading, and spending time with my two kitties. I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and finding creative inspiration both in science and in everyday life.
