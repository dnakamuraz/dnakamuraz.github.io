Welcome to my website! My name is Sakib and I am a PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.mcw.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu/). I obtained my MS in [Mathematics (Statistics emphasis)](https://www.boisestate.edu/math/) from [Boise State University](https://www.boisestate.edu/) and my BS in [Statistics](https://www.du.ac.bd/) from the [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/).  
<br>
My research focuses on developing and applying Bayesian methods for variable selection, external data borrowing, and cancer genomics. I am particularly interested in advancing statistical methodologies that integrate multi-source biomedical data to improve inference and decision-making in clinical and genomic research.  
<br>
I am passionate about the intersection of biostatistics, computation, and translational science, with the long-term goal of contributing to data-driven innovations in precision medicine and public health.  
<br>
Outside of research, I enjoy watching movies, going to trivia nights with friends, traveling, and reading. I love exploring new places, learning about different cultures, and finding creative inspiration both in science and in everyday life.
